# Business case

Hyros is a software product that allows marketers, particularly in the information space, to track ad revenue to the dollar and is used by the likes of Tom Biylieu's SuperHuman and 
Dean Graziosi. Hyros is very expensive, generally costing $2,000 to $20,000 a month and is only used by clients that are spending over $20,000 a month on paid advertising. The 
company is looking to expand their sales team, the problem is that 

1. finding talent can take a while which will leave the sales team working overtime or the setting back the company's
agenda
2. a highly specialized product like Hyros is only intended for a specific type of client. It can be hard to tell who is a good fit for the product and could be especially 
difficult for a new team member
3. evaluating prospects is time consuming

What if we could automate parts of the prospecting process and allow Hyros to close more deals in the same amount of time by identifying which leads to prioritize aquiring as 
clients?

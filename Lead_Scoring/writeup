# Business case

Hyros is a software product that allows marketers, particularly in the information space, to track ad revenue to the dollar and is used by the likes of Tom Biylieu's SuperHuman and 
Dean Graziosi. Hyros is very expensive, generally costing $2,000 to $20,000 a month and is only used by clients that are spending over $20,000 a month on paid advertising. The 
company is looking to expand their sales team, the problem is that 

1. finding talent can take a while which will leave the sales team working overtime or the setting back the company's
agenda
2. a highly specialized product like Hyros is only intended for a specific type of client. It can be hard to tell who is a good fit for the product and could be especially 
difficult for a new team member
3. evaluating prospects is time consuming

What if we could automate parts of the prospecting process and allow Hyros to close more deals in the same amount of time by identifying which leads to prioritize aquiring as 
clients?

# Requirements
* must quantify the likleyhood of conversion given a potential client
* should estimate ACV (annual contract value) and calculate their LTV (lifetime value)
* model explainability is needed for the pricing model, but is only preffered for the scoring
* takes in data in the form of a spreadsheet 

# Solution
* a deployed web app 
* binary classification model
* regression model
* simple algorithm to calculate LTV

# Feasability
* A lot of this data will come from Salesforce, this could be really easy but it could be really hard, I just don't know yet
* I anticipate the ACV and LTV model to be more difficult than the scoring model

# KPI's
## model metrics
* scoring model: f1 score. false negatives and false positives are equally bad but most prospects don't convert, this means our data is imbalanced, this means that accuracy is
not a good metric.
* ACV model: accuracy. I feel like Root Means Squared Error might be better but it is less interpretable to the end user than accuracy.

## business metrics
* closing ratio. If we can help the sales team focus on aquiring the customers that are more likley to convert than Hyros will close a higher percentage of their SQL's
* Sales Cycle Length. If our model is good, it will automate a signifigant chunk of the vetting process, thus making the sales cycle faster. However, it must be noted that there
is a human element, and there's a chance that this can't be speeded up because doing so may be too pushy on the customer. Even if this is the case, we can free up employees to 
work on other tasks.
* SQL-to-MQL conversion rate. Hyros's top priority is to step up their outbound outreach and get more sales qulaified leads (SQL's) they are already highly satisfied with 
marketing qualified leads (MQL's), by increasing closing ratio this metric will naturally improve

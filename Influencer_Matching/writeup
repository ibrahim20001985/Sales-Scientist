# Business Case

Alphaleate is a fitness apparel brand that uses Influencer Marketing heavily. Influencer Marketing, in a nutshell, is paying influencers on a long term contract or salary to promote your brand. Many brands have found it effective because it is one of the most organic ways to market to people in the digital age and builds rapport with customers much faster than paid traffic or celebrity endorsments in many cases! The problem here is that finding the right influencers to promote and represent your brand can be very ime consuming. The Co-Founder and head of marketing spend hours a day on social media looking for the right people to sponsor. If Alphaleate had a way to automate this process more time could be put back into the product and other higher level tasks.

# Requirements 
* the model we use must be transparent and explainable to the end user
* the model must give each influencer a score but also provide a hard yes or no (whether or not they should be sponsored)

# Solution
* build a classification model that tells the user whether or not they should sponsor each influencer 
* also output the score on a scale of 0 to 1

# Feasiblity
The project seems very doable except I will have to work around the lack of labled data. One way I could do this is by using a clustering algorithm, this is bad because these algorithms are slow. However there is data labeling software, the data will take longer to label but once it's done we can use any algorithm and therefore opt for a faster one. 

# KPI's
## model metrics
Precision. In this case having false positives (matches that are given a high score when it should be low) are worse than false having negatives

## business metrics
referral traffic, this means the influncer is driving traffic to the company. ROI of individual influencer, a model that selects the righ influencers will have a higher ROI from their campaigns.

# Technical Requirements
* will need to use a data labeling software

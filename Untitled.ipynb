    "How many times can I analyze each headline?\n",
    "Headline Studio allows you to analyze up to 25 versions of each headline. When you reach your limit of versions for a headline, you can use a new headline to keep analyzing.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the difference between Premium Headlines and Standard Headlines?\n",
    "Premium Headlines are analyzed with premium features only available in Headline Studio Pro. Standard Headlines are analyzed with limited features in Headline Studio Free.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the difference between headlines and versions?\n",
    "Versions are the iterations of each headline that you reanalyze. For example, you might write and reanalyze 10 different versions of a single blog headline before moving on to a different headline for another piece of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can I try Headline Studio Pro before I buy?\n",
    "No, but you’ll receive 3 free Premium Headlines to try out when you start a Headline Studio Free plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many headlines will I need?\n",
    "That depends on how much content you write. If you write 5+ blogs each month, we recommend a higher-headline plan. If you write just a few, try a smaller plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I need more than 60 headlines?\n",
    "Contact CoSchedule Support to increase your headline limit and get additional pricing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can I switch to a different plan?\n",
    "Yes. To switch to a different Headline Studio plan, just visit the billing page in your CoSchedule account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will my unused headlines roll over to next month?\n",
    "No. Your headline count will automatically reset to your monthly quota at the beginning of each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if I run out of Premium Headlines?\n",
    "If you’re already in a Headline Studio Pro plan, your headline quota will reset at the beginning of the next month. If you don’t want to wait (or you’re using Headline Studio Free), upgrade your Headline Studio Pro plan.\n",

       "'download report now yes i am ready to get started today  we will not spam rent or sell your information    custom javascript  htmlnew book revealshow to create internet campaigns that sell   frank kernfrom the desk of frank kernla jolla ca dear friendif youd like to create internet campaigns that sell like crazy  regardless of your industry this is the most important letter youll read today ill show you why in a minute but first    a disclaimer please understand my results im sharing with you are not typical  i’m not implying you’ll duplicate them or do anything for that matter i have the benefit of practicing direct response marketing and advertising for 19 years and have an established following as a result the average person who buys any how to information gets little to no results  i’m using these references for example purposes only your results will vary and depend on many factors including but not limited to your background experience and work ethic all business entails risk as well as massive and consistent effort and action  if youre not willing to accept that please do not get this book with that said  let me jump right in and show youexactly what youre gettingthis is dramatically different from anything youve ever read because its more of a field guide to advertising for massive success than a traditional book the reason why is because theres no fluff or filler  it immediately gets down to brass tacks showing you exactly what to do how to do it and why plus its easy to read at just 75 pages you can read it in an afternoon  and youll immediately get the entire methodology i personally used to create some of the most successful internet advertising promotions in history heres just a fraction of whats inside and what it might mean

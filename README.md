## How to make a Data Science project that employers actually give a s*it about...

You you need to show business acumen, this means that you learn the business behind the domain you work in and build projects with respect to the businesses needs and constraints. The first step to a project that will actually get you hired is to identify a marketplace or specific niche/domain of business to apply Data Science to!

I have 6 solid project ideas and I'm having a hard time picking one, I'll start working on all 6 to get a flavor for them. After 5 days I'll pick 3 projects to abandon and 3 to keep working on, after 2 days I'll narrow down to 2, 5 days after that I'll narrow down to just one.

## Here are my project ideas:

For each project I will list the project, the sample client, the domain in paranthesis, and the department in brackets

1. Lead Scoring for Hyros (high ticket software)[sales]
2. KPI Analysis for Tiger Fitness's Youtube Channel (eCommerce brands that rely on Youtube for traffic)[marketing]
3. Affiliate Inspection for Pollen (consumer services)[pr & marketing]
4. mini Digital Marketing work product; provide insights for 4 different marketing strategies for My Spa Rocket (Marketing agencies)[Product Management]

## How to make a Data Science project that employers actually give a s*it about...

You you need to show business acumen, this means that you learn the business behind the domain you work in and build projects with respect to the businesses needs and constraints. The first step to a project that will actually get you hired is to identify a marketplace or specific niche/domain of business to apply Data Science to!

## I am stuck between 2 ideas...

For each project I will list the project, the sample client, the domain in paranthesis, and the department in brackets

1. Lead Scoring for Hyros (high ticket software)[sales]
2. KPI Analysis for Tiger Fitness's Youtube Channel (eCommerce brands that rely on Youtube for traffic)[marketing]

I will spend a week working on both projects at the same time and then I'll go forward with just one.

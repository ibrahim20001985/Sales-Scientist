# Lead Scoring for Hyros

## Business case
Hyros is a software that allows advertisers and digital marketers to accuratley attribute the return on their advertising (ROAS) accross platforms. The company has been delivering amazing results for their customers who mostly come in by word of mouth. However they are looking towards outbound outreach to scale higher and are looking to hire more salespeople. Hyros wants to grow and it can only scale so high with word of mouth so it's ramping up outbound strategies. The goal here is to see if we can make the sales process more efficient, this way the sales team can retain or increase it's closing rate and Hyros won't need to make as many hires; 1) save time, 2) save money, 3) more closing = more money.

## The problem
Finding the right prospects is time consuming. This is a common problem in sales and marketing, however this especially is an issue for Hyros because they are selective about the customers they choose to onboard. How much would it suck to expand a sales team only to have them bring in customers that are unualified or unlikley to benefit from the service? a lot! Getting the wrong customers on sales calls will decrease closing rates, especially SQL-to-MQL, at best and create negative customer experiences that reflect badly on the company at worst.

## Requirements
* Be able to quantify the quality of a given lead.

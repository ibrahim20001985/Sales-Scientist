## How to make a Data Science project that employers actually give a s*it about...

You you need to show business acumen, this means that you learn the business behind the domain you work in and build projects with respect to the businesses needs and constraints. The first step to a project that will actually get you hired is to identify a marketplace or specific niche/domain of business to apply Data Science to!

Aim for domains you are either passionate about, interested in, or have big revenue.
Here are some I could do...
* fitness brands (ie. Gymshark)
* Youtube content creators
* Digital Marketing Agencies  
* indie robot and drone makers
* hip hop music venues
* VC firms
* Life Insurance
* Something related to fish/seafood suppliers


At least for now I will start with Influencer Marketing with respect to fitness brands

Creative Era Media is a Social Media Marketing Agency that specializes in paid traffic for eCommerce brands, mostly through Facebook and Instagram. The agency is still small and 
the founder wants to scale. While outreach is an important part of client aquisition, it is also valuable to increase the closing rate at meetings. This way they can bring on more 
clients while having the same amount of meetings, therefore more money, the same time, and less time lost to meetings that don't drive the bottom line. If they can increase the ROI
on time spent doing client outreach and meetings than outreach can be scaled higher and yield signifigantly more clients and therefore revenue. This sounds great in theorey, but 
how can we actually make it happen? Sales is not easy, it is a very nuanced skillset that can take a while to develop. However if Creative Era could get a full inspection on their 
clients in preperation for consultations they would have more clarity on how to best service the client and sell with more conviction.

# Requirements
* provide deep insights on the current state of the client that are hard to find and are very unlikley to come up in a discovery call
* findings must be presented in a visually appealing and comprehensive manner
* if machine learning is used than the model must be explainable, no black box models
* must touch on information that is valuable to the end user; a Digital Marketing Consultant
* Visulizations must be able to go inside a powerpoint, this most likley means it will have to be a Tableau Dashboard
* must pull data on request from the user but dosen't need any automated data collection pipeline
* I will need to embed the dashboard into a deployed web app so that it can work in tandem with the ml

# Soultion
* An interactive dashboard that shows social media engagement of their clients
* Euclidean Distance, or other distance formula, to compare the prospect to past clients and competitors
* Bonus: connection to Facebook Ads API to show estimated campaign reach for the client, just so the user dosen't have to look this up and just stay in one place (the app)

# Feasability
Facebook's API's have been a real pain in the ass in my experience, however this is the only signifigant bottleneck.

# KPI's 
## model metrics
There aren't any as this is an unsupervised problem

## business metrics
* Closing Rate: increasing this is the main goal, as this work product is intended to help Creative Era close more. This is the same whether the client is an SQL or a MQL.
* Quote-to-Close ratio
* Average Conversion Time: by helping the consultant better understand the client they should be able to close with fewer meetings

# technical requirements
* needs to access public posts and ads on Facebook and Instagram

# The Dataset
We will need the following data and data sources...
* facebook posts and ads data for testimonial clients
* Instagram posts and ads data for testimonial clients
* Facebook and Instagram engadgement data over the past 4 years for testimonial clients

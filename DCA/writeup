Creative Era Media is a Social Media Marketing Agency that specializes in paid traffic for eCommerce brands, mostly through Facebook and Instagram. The agency is still small and 
the founder wants to scale. While outreach is an important part of client aquisition, it is also valuable to increase the closing rate at meetings. This way they can bring on more 
clients while having the same amount of meetings, therefore more money, the same time, and less time lost to meetings that don't drive the bottom line. If they can increase the ROI
on time spent doing client outreach and meetings than outreach can be scaled higher and yield signifigantly more clients and therefore revenue. This sounds great in theorey, but 
how can we actually make it happen? Sales is not easy, it is a very nuanced skillset that can take a while to develop. However if Creative Era could get a full inspection on their 
clients in preperation for consultations they would have more clarity on how to best service the client and sell with more conviction.

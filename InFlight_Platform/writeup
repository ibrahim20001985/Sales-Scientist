# Business Case
My Spa Rocket is a Social Media Marketing Agency that specializes in Facebook ads, SMS marketing, and Lead generation for spas looking to get more customers in the door. The agency
is dedicated to getting their clients results and has formulated a highly effictive strategy for doing so. The concern is that larger agencies, Power Digital Marketing for example,
are building highly effective Machine Learning and Analytics platforms that allow the agencies to automate the process of picking the optimal marketing tactics and strategy unique
to each client. This allows for faster delivery and in most cases higher ROI for the client. By specializing in the spa niche the agency has a mote in place, but a Machine Learning 
and Analytics platform customized to the spa domain would keep them ahead of the curve provide that it is done well.

Objective: Futureproof My Spa Rocket

# Requirements
* Predict the preformance of campaigns before they launch
* Track the preformance of campaigns after they launch
* Idenify the best platform to focus on for the individual client 
* Compare different strategies against eachother within the platform for that particular client
* model outputs and valuable findings from the data should be presented in a way that is easy for nontechnical marketing proffessionals to understand
* model explainability is strongly desired
* able to constantly pull new data and update models and visulizations as new data is introduced [how often?]
prefferred...
* Extract insights about the agency's client's customer bases. As well as the target market of spa visitors as a whole
* give guidance on how to set parameters within the digital marketing strategy

# Solution
While the scope of this project is a bit broad, there will be 5 distinct componets.
1. Social Media Data Collection Pipeline
2. KPI analysis dashboard
3. Platform Selection via classification model
4. Strategy Selection via classification model
5. Campaign results data collection pipeline
6. Bonus. Strategy parameter setting algorithms

# Feasability
I will touch on the feasability of each part of this proposed solution
1. getting ahold of SMS data is unlikley to be feasable, I've had a really hard time getting data from Facebook in the past but I can probably find a workaround. Instagram and 
Snapchat will likley be pretty easy to access. The goal will be for this workproduct to collect data from Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.
2. Building the Dashboard and Visulizations will be easy, but the data from step 1 must be valuable for the dashboard to be effective.
3. This part of the project will be very feasible and computationally efficient as it will be a very simple algorithm
4. This part is very unlikley to be feasible. If most of there clients are on crunchbase I can access the Salesforce CRM's to get the data. However this is 
unlikley to be of much value. I could generate toy data to make a POC model to get the stakeholders excited about it.
5. I need buy in for this to work, I can't access this data in my own.
6. in the same boat as #4

# KPI's
This project is going to be an in depth analysis combined with a toy example of an ml model. The model will be tied to imaginary data. 

model metric: accuracy
imaginary business metric: Return On Ad Spend (ROAS). We are ultimatley striving to optimize this metric so that the agency can give their clients a better ROI.

# Technical requirements

# The Data
for a rough description I will list what all should be collected as far as data goes...
* advertising data for all the clients on Facebook and Instagram
* user engagement data for all the clients on Facebook and Instagram
* data representative of the spa niche on Facebook and Instagram
* data generated with data generation algorithms, this will fill in the gaps
* if I get buy in from stakeholders than I will request the ad campaign data and results from all their clients

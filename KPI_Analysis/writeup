# Business case

Tiger Fitness is an eCommerce brand in the fitness industry. The company primarially sells supplements but also sells some apparel and offers fitness coaching services as well. 
The CEO & Founder has a very successful Youtube Channel that serves as a line of defense against the Amazon. A customer of Tiger Fitness can just as equally order their supplements 
on Amazon. However the youtube channel provides a personal connection and has encouraged many people to get in shape during the pandemic with home workout videos, this personal 
connection builds more trust than Amazon and is therefore able to stay competitive. In short, Tiger Fitness's obssesive care for their customer as well as guidance and personal 
connection offered by the youtube channel and coaching services allows it to flourish throughout the rise of Amazon and the pandemic. The problem is that Youtube is becoming a 
highly competitive and saturated space, Tiger Fitness competes with 0.12% of Youtube (this is actually huge considering the size of Youtube). With a highly customized 
analytics dashboard Tiger Fitness could obtain insights that few other channels have access to, this would help the brand build a wider and deeper moat. The youtube channel is a 
key driver of revenue for Tiger Fitness and this would be a valuable area for them to apply Data Analytics. 

# Requirements
* interactive dashboard showcasing EDA portion of the project
* EDA should focus to the relationship of youtube KPI's to the Business KPI's as well as click-through-rate (CTR)
* predict percent viewed, audiance retention, subscriber growth, views, rewatches, and actions after viewing given a video idea
* predict youtube ad revenue given a video idea
* model explainability is preffered

# Solution
* The vast majority of data will be pulled from the Youtube API. I will probably have to store requested data from to a database
* simple algorithm that predicts ad revenue given views. Machine Learning here would be overkill
* 6 regression models of some sort, to predict the 6 other KPI's
* Deployed web app with an embeded dashboard

# Feasability
* The data will be easy to collect 
* The model deployment and dashboard will be very feasible as long as I steer clear of Deep Learning
* The challenge here will be setting up a pipeline that allows the data to be updated constantly. I've seen a workaround for this problem that involves Docker and AWS, both of
which scare me

# KPI's
## model metrics
accuracy, MAE, RMSE, MSE
* percent viewed:
* audiance retention:
* subscriber growth:
* views:
* rewatches:
* actions after viewing: 

## youtube metrics
percent viewed, audiance retention, subscriber growth, views, rewatches

## business metrics
* actions after viewing
* ad revenue

# Technical requirements
* no deep learning for latency reasons
* Docker for running the data request script in a virtual machine rather than my computer
* AWS for creating a database with unlimited access for storing the youtube data

# The Dataset
* Youtube API

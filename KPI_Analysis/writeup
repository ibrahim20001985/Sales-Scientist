# Business case

Tiger Fitness is an eCommerce brand in the fitness industry. The company primarially sells supplements but also sells some apparel and offers fitness coaching services as well. 
The CEO & Founder has a very successful Youtube Channel that serves as a line of defense against the Amazon. A customer of Tiger Fitness can just as equally order their supplements 
on Amazon. However the youtube channel provides a personal connection and has encouraged many people to get in shape during the pandemic with home workout videos, this personal 
connection builds more trust than Amazon and is therefore able to stay competitive. In short, Tiger Fitness's obssesive care for their customer as well as guidance and personal 
connection offered by the youtube channel and coaching services allows it to flourish throughout the rise of Amazon and the pandemic. The problem is that Youtube is becoming a 
highly competitive and saturated space, Tiger Fitness competes with 0.12% of Youtube (this is actually huge considering the size of Youtube). With a highly customized 
analytics dashboard Tiger Fitness could obtain insights that few other channels have access to, this would help the brand build a wider and deeper moat. The youtube channel is a 
key driver of revenue for Tiger Fitness and this would be a valuable area for them to apply Data Analytics.
